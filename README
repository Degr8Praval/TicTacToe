Tic-Tac-Toe in C++

Overview
--------
This is a console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in C++. 
It allows two players to play against each other on a 3x3 board. 
The program displays the board in the terminal, accepts player moves, 
checks for wins or draws, and announces the outcome.

Features
--------
- Text-based visual board representation
- Two-player gameplay (Player X and Player O)
- Detects wins, draws, and invalid moves
- Simple and easy-to-understand C++ code structure
- Can be extended with AI opponent or additional features

Getting Started
---------------
Requirements:
- C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++)
- Command-line interface / terminal

Compilation:
Open your terminal in the project directory and run:
g++ -std=c++11 -o tictactoe tictactoe.cpp
This will produce an executable named 'tictactoe'.

Running the Program:
Run the program in your terminal:
./tictactoe
Follow the on-screen prompts to enter your moves.
Moves are entered as row and column numbers (0-based indexing).

How to Play
-----------
1. The game starts with Player X.
2. Players take turns entering their move as row and column numbers.
3. The program updates the board after each move.
4. The game announces when a player wins or if the game ends in a draw.
5. The game ends automatically when a win or draw occurs.
